# IBM_Capstone_Project
This was the final project of the IBM Data Science Certificate program. The aim of this project was to attempt to find a correlation betwwen the population growth in a region and it's moltality rate due to unclean water. As the population in a region increases the supply of drinking water will most likely decrease causing a negative feedback effect. I used multiple regression models to find the best predictive model for the moltality rate in the region. I also focused on Sub-Saharan Africa because it's the region with the greatest population growth rate and one of the regions with the lowest access to drinking water.
